School Comparisons
	In this exercise, I took data sets of data from 15 different schools and compared them based on various factors such as size, school type, budget, and more, as well as comparing students at the same school by what year they are in. In doing so, one conclusion I am able to draw is that Charter schools perform better on average compared to public schools, with over ninety percent of students at these schools passing in both math and reading compared to just over half of students at public schools. Another conclusion I gathered based on this data is that the less money is spent per capita, the better on average students do, with students at schools spending less than $585 per student performing the best with over ninety percent passing math and reading, and as spending increases student performance decreases, with the lowest performance of just over half of students passing math and reading at schools spending $645-$680 per student, which was the highest spending per student I looked at. It is however important to understand the limitations of this data and not to draw too many conclusions from it. This only looks at fifteen schools, so the sample size is relatively small. Additionally, though this data can tell us what is happening at these schools, it doesnâ€™t explain why this is happening, and it is possible that some of these factors may not actually matter independently, but that if one factor is true, then it is very likely that another factor is also true and the second factor is the only one that actually matters. So while we can interpret the data as being empirically true, it is important to not draw too many conclusions from it.
